Refactor of Concert Tracker App Using Angular

This is the second iteration of the concert tracker app. This time I around I wanted to use Angular for the front end. As a result, my code base (in particular my controllers) was much cleaner. I had far less repitition since I was not forced to use only JQuery and handlebars to render templates.

This app was created mainly as a test for refactoring the app in Angular. I only have one object complete with full CRUD operations. While this is a great improvement over the initial app, the file structure of the app is still somewhat confusing, and my controllers are still bloated.

For the next iteration, I will refactor this app to use services to make my AJAX calls
